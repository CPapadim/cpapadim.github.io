{"name":"Cpapadim.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"### Hello, I'm Harry.\r\nI'm a quantitative storyteller.  I enjoy taking strings of words in the form of questions, turning them into numbers and math, using data to find quantitative answers, and finally turning those quantitative answers into compelling stories.\r\n\r\nOn this page you will find a few examples of some of the projects I've worked on. \r\n\r\n### Signal Processing Package\r\nIn order to tell truly compelling stories about data a storyteller often needs to create customized storytelling tools.  I wrote this package to help me tell stories about how brains work.  It can analyze time series of action potentials and local field potentials from the brain in both the frequency and time domains to help users uncover how these different brain signals relate to each other and contribute to driving behavior.  \r\n\r\n[Signal Processing Toolkit](https://github.com/CPapadim/Signal-Processing-Toolkit)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
